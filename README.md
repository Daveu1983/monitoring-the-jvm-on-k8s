# Monitoring the JVM on Kubernetes

## Pre-requisites

Tools:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
- [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
- [helm 2](https://github.com/helm/helm#install)

## Setup

_NOTE: these instructions have been tested on MacOS Catalina 10.5._

To bootstrap your `minikube` cluster simply run the `bootstrap.sh` script.

This will enable the following capabilities:

- A Kubernetes cluster on v.1.15.9
- Helm 2
- Prometheus operator (via [helm](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator))

## Expose the Prometheus services on your local host

We'll use [port-forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) to expose the services running on the cluster to your local machine.

The `port-forwading.sh` script will do this for us.

## Deploy an app

The application we will deploy is called [Chaos Kraken](https://github.com/autotraderuk/chaos-kraken) and it is designed to simulate various failure scenarios.

[Chaos Kraken](https://github.com/autotraderuk/chaos-kraken) is an open source project created at [Auto Trader UK](https://careers.autotrader.co.uk/). It is used to test and validate various behaviours of their Kubernetes based delivery platform.

```bash
./deploy-chaos-kraken.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Check your prometheus config

```bash
kubectl -n monitoring get secret prometheus-prometheus-prometheus-oper-prometheus -ojson | jq -r '.data["prometheus.yaml.gz"]' | base64 -d | gunzip
```

### Grafana username & password

The username & password for Grafana are stored in a secret:

```bash
kubectk get secret -n monitoring prometheus-grafana -ojson | jq -r '.data["admin-user"]' | base64 -d
kubectl get secret -n monitoring prometheus-grafana -ojson | jq -r '.data["admin-password"]' | base64 -d
```

The defaults are `admin/prom-operator` and as we are running this locally via Minikube we won't worry about making it more secure.

# Monitoring the JVM on Kubernetes - GKE and Helm v3

##Setup
Prior to running the bootstrap script you will need to export two variables PROJECT_ID which is the name of the project on GCP you would like to provision the cluster on and ZONE which is the region and zone you would like to provisioin the cluster on in GCP.
